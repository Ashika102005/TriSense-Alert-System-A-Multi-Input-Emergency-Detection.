# TriSense-Alert-System-A-Multi-Input-Emergency-Detection.
The demand for efficient medical emergency response systems is crucial for patients who may be unable to communicate their distress due to medical conditions. This system introduces the TriSense Alert System, a software-based solution that integrates real-time facial expression detection, voice recognition, and touch-based emergency triggers. Facial emotion analysis is carried out using DeepFace, which apply deep-learning models to identify distress-related emotions such as fear, anger, or sadness. The system utilizes Vosk-Kaldi, a deep learning-based speech recognition engine, to analyze emergency phrases like "help" or "help me". To prevent malfunctions in voice or facial recognition, an additional manual input mechanism is included as a fail-safe. When distress is detected through any of these methods, Twilio is used to send automated alerts to designated guardians. If no response is received within a predetermined time, the system escalates the alert to the nearest hospital, transmitting critical patient details such as location and medical history. This software-driven approach enhances emergency detection, ensuring timely medical intervention and also paving the way for hardware deployment in the future.
